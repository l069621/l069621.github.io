## 📈 Pharmacometrics in metablolic and neuroscience therapeutic areas

**Advisor-Pharmacometrician, Eli Lilly and Company (Jun 2024 - Present)**\
Global PK/PD/PMx department\
*Supervisor: Dr. Nieves Velez de Mendizabal*

My current research at Eli Lilly and Company focuses on the development and application of quantitative pharmacology and pharmacometrics to support drug development in metabolic and neuroscience therapeutic areas.

## 🧠 Alzheimer's Disease & Type 2 Diabetes & Blood-Brain Barrier Dysfunction

**Graduate Research Assistant, University of Minnesota (Nov 2019 – May 2024)**\
Department of Pharmaceutics\
*Advisor: Dr. Karunya K. Kandimalla*

My dissertation research focused on understanding how amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides and insulin resistance contribute to cerebrovascular dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease, with a special emphasis on the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Key accomplishments include:

-   📊 Developed a **population pharmacokinetic model** to study Aβ isoform trafficking and accumulation at the BBB endothelium.\
    *Published in [Molecular Pharmaceutics](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.1c00549)*
    
![Aβ PK model](media/Research/abeta_trafficking_model.jpeg)

-   🔬 Conducted **flow cytometry, western blot, and confocal imaging** to investigate distinct molecular mechanisms of Aβ uptake and intracellular trafficking in BBB endothelial cells.\
    *Published in [Molecular Pharmacology](https://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/article/S0026-895X(24)00059-2/abstract)*

-   🧠 Established a **compartmental PK model** to deconvolve plasma kinetics of imaging tracers from dynamic SPECT/CT heart scans.\
    *Published in [Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics](https://jpet.aspetjournals.org/article/S0022-3565(24)17050-4/abstract)*
    
![Deconvoltution of plasma PK from heart imaging](media/Research/heart_deconvolution.png)

-   🧪 Studied the effect of **HDL mimetic peptides and gut microbiome metabolites** on Aβ accumulation using dynamic imaging and cellular assays.\
    *Published in [Molecular Pharmaceutics](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.4c00633)*

![4F effect on Amyloid beta PK](media/Research/4f_paper.png)

-   🧬 Interpreted **time-series transcriptomics** of insulin-exposed BBB endothelial cells and co-authored the manuscript.\
    *Published in [NPJ Systems Biology and Applications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-022-00235-8)*

-   🔁 Built a **quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model** to simulate insulin signaling and VCAM1 expression in BBB endothelial cells. Integrated proteomics and transcriptomics to study vascular inflammation in Alzheimer’s disease.\
    *Published in [CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/psp4.13296)*

## 🧬 Modeling Neurodegenerative Disease Progression

**Modeling & Simulation Co-op, Biogen Inc. (Jan – Jun 2023)**\
Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics\
*Supervisor: Dr. Jingxian (JC) Chen*

-   📈 Conducted **model-based meta-analysis (MBMA)** of MDS-UPDRS data to support early Parkinson’s disease (PD) trial design.

-   🧮 Built **nonlinear mixed-effect models** (in NONMEM and Monolix) to describe disease progression and time-to-event outcomes.

-   📊 Simulated longitudinal endpoint profiles to evaluate study designs and dosing strategies.

-   🗣️ Presented modeling results and impact to internal project teams and stakeholders.\
    *Presented at ACoP14*

-   🧪 Developed a **PK/PD model for antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapy** in PD and simulated alternate regimens to inform dose optimization.
