## Overview

My research focuses on the intersection of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP), and mathematical modeling to improve the understanding of complex disease mechanisms and inform therapeutic development.

I am particularly interested in applying modeling and simulation approaches to support drug development in neurological and metabolic diseases, including:

- **Alzheimerâ€™s disease**
- **Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes**
- **Blood-brain barrier (BBB) transport**
- **Cerebrovascular dysfunction**

## Current Research Areas

### ðŸ§  Alzheimerâ€™s Disease & Blood-Brain Barrier Modeling

- Investigating how amyloid-beta (AÎ²) peptides impact endothelial function and inflammation at the BBB
- Modeling the role of insulin resistance and p38 MAPK signaling in BBB dysfunction
- Using dynamic SPECT/CT imaging and PK modeling to assess AÎ²42 brain distribution
- Evaluating the therapeutic potential of HDL mimetic peptides (e.g., 4F) to restore BBB integrity

---

### ðŸ’‰ Diabetes & Insulin Therapy

- Population PK/PD modeling of novel insulin analogs
- Dose projection for first-in-human (FIH) studies using preclinical data
- Disease progression modeling of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease

---

### ðŸ”¬ Methodologies

- Mechanistic compartmental and systems pharmacology modeling
- Sex-specific modeling of AÎ² transport and vascular dysfunction

---

## Selected Projects

- **Modeling HDL mimetic peptide effects on AÎ² transport at the BBB**  
  *Dynamic imaging + PK modeling to quantify influx/efflux changes*

- **QSP modeling of insulin signaling pathways in the brain**  
  *Exploring insulin resistance in Alzheimerâ€™s disease*

- **Individualized PD simulation for dose optimization**  
  *Built a Shiny app to explore dosing scenarios by patient subgroup*

## Let's Collaborate

Iâ€™m always open to collaborations in systems pharmacology, BBB modeling, and model-informed drug development.
