## 🧠 Alzheimer's Disease & Blood-Brain Barrier Dysfunction  
**PhD Research, University of Minnesota (Nov 2019 – May 2024)**  
Graduate Research Assistant  
*Advisor: Dr. Karunya K. Kandimalla*

My dissertation research focused on understanding how amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides and insulin resistance contribute to cerebrovascular dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease, with a special emphasis on the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Key accomplishments include:

- 📊 Developed a **population pharmacokinetic model** to study Aβ isoform trafficking and accumulation at the BBB endothelium.  
  *Published in [Molecular Pharmaceutics](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.1c00549)*

- 🔬 Conducted **flow cytometry, western blot, and confocal imaging** to investigate distinct molecular mechanisms of Aβ uptake and intracellular trafficking in BBB endothelial cells.  
  *Published in [Molecular Pharmacology](https://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/article/S0026-895X(24)00059-2/abstract)*

- 🧠 Established a **compartmental PK model** to deconvolve plasma kinetics of imaging tracers from dynamic SPECT/CT heart scans.  
  *Published in [Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics](https://jpet.aspetjournals.org/article/S0022-3565(24)17050-4/abstract)*

- 🧪 Studied the effect of **HDL mimetic peptides and gut microbiome metabolites** on Aβ accumulation using dynamic imaging and cellular assays.  
  *Published in [Molecular Pharmaceutics](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.4c00633)*

- 🧬 Interpreted **time-series transcriptomics** of insulin-exposed BBB endothelial cells and co-authored the manuscript.  
  *Published in [NPJ Systems Biology and Applications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-022-00235-8)*

- 🔁 Built a **quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model** to simulate insulin signaling and VCAM1 expression in BBB endothelial cells. Integrated proteomics and transcriptomics to study vascular inflammation in Alzheimer’s disease.  
  *Published in [CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/psp4.13296)*

## 🧬 Modeling Neurodegenerative Disease Progression  
**Modeling & Simulation Co-op, Biogen Inc. (Jan – Jun 2023)**  
Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics  
*Supervisor: Dr. Jingxian (JC) Chen*

- 📈 Conducted **model-based meta-analysis (MBMA)** of MDS-UPDRS data to support early Parkinson’s disease (PD) trial design.
- 🧮 Built **nonlinear mixed-effect models** (in NONMEM and Monolix) to describe disease progression and time-to-event outcomes.
- 📊 Simulated longitudinal endpoint profiles to evaluate study designs and dosing strategies.
- 🗣️ Presented modeling results and impact to internal project teams and stakeholders.  
  *Presented at ACoP14*

- 🧪 Developed a **PK/PD model for antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapy** in PD and simulated alternate regimens to inform dose optimization.

## 🧪 Imaging Probe Development for Cancer Detection  
**Undergraduate Research Assistant, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (Oct 2016 – Jun 2019)**  
*Advisor: Dr. Qingqing Meng*

- 🧫 Designed and synthesized **bimodal NIR and PET imaging probes** targeting CYP1B1 for early tumor detection.
- 🔬 Evaluated binding affinity and selectivity in CYP1B1-overexpressing cancer cell lines using flow cytometry and confocal imaging.
- 🧠 Performed in vivo/ex vivo biodistribution and tumor visualization imaging.  
  *Published in J. Med. Chem. and ChemBioChem.*

## 🧪 BBB Drug Delivery for Alzheimer’s Therapy  
**Summer Research Intern, University of Tokyo / iCONM (Summer 2018)**  
*Supervisor: Dr. Kazunori Kataoka*

- 🧪 Prepared **PEGylated anti-Aβ antibodies** and characterized them with GPC and DLS.
- 🧠 Assessed **brain delivery and pharmacokinetics** of modified antibodies to improve BBB penetration in Alzheimer’s disease.
