## 👋 About Me Outside the Lab

When I’m not modeling pharmacokinetics or optimizing drug development pipelines, I enjoy a variety of activities that help me stay grounded, creative, and connected.

## 🌱 Hobbies & Interests

-   **Gardening** — I find peace and joy in growing herbs and vegetables, especially during spring and summer. Watching something grow over time reminds me of both science and patience.
-   **Cooking** — Experimenting with new recipes is one of my favorite creative outlets. I enjoy cooking traditional Chinese dishes and trying global cuisines.
-   **Table Tennis & Badminton** — Great ways to stay active and have fun with friends and family.
-   **Mahjong** — I love playing mahjong with friends — it’s strategic, social, and always entertaining.
