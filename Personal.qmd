## 👋 About Me Outside the Lab

When I’m not modeling pharmacokinetics or optimizing drug development pipelines, I enjoy a variety of activities that help me stay grounded, creative, and connected.

---

## 🌱 Hobbies & Interests

- **Gardening** — I find peace and joy in growing herbs and vegetables, especially during spring and summer. Watching something grow over time reminds me of both science and patience.
- **Cooking** — Experimenting with new recipes is one of my favorite creative outlets. I enjoy cooking traditional Chinese dishes and trying global cuisines.
- **Table Tennis & Badminton** — Great ways to stay active and have fun with friends and family.
- **Mahjong** — I love playing mahjong with friends — it’s strategic, social, and always entertaining.

## 🌄 Travel & Nature

I’ve had the pleasure of visiting several breathtaking national parks, including:

- 🏞️ **Yellowstone National Park**
- 🏔️ **Grand Teton National Park**
- 🍁 **Banff National Park** (Canada)

I love spending time in nature — hiking, exploring, and soaking in the peace of the outdoors.
