## 👋 About Me Outside the Lab

When I’m not modeling pharmacokinetics or optimizing drug development
pipelines, I enjoy a variety of activities that help me stay grounded,
creative, and connected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🌱 Hobbies & Interests

-   **Gardening** — I find peace and joy in growing herbs and
    vegetables, especially during spring and summer. Watching something
    grow over time reminds me of both science and patience.
-   **Cooking** — Experimenting with new recipes is one of my favorite
    creative outlets. I enjoy cooking traditional Chinese dishes and
    trying global cuisines.
-   **Table Tennis & Badminton** — Great ways to stay active and have
    fun with friends and family.
-   **Mahjong** — I love playing mahjong with friends — it’s strategic,
    social, and always entertaining.

peace of the outdoors.

## 🏠 Life in Indiana

I currently live in the Greater Indianapolis area, where Lu and I
recently bought our first home 🏡. It’s been a wonderful journey turning
a house into a home, and we’re excited for what the future holds here.

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧 Family

I come from a loving family with two amazing older sisters. We remain
very close, even as our lives have taken us to different parts of the
world.
