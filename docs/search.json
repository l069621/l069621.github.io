Kandimalla\nMy dissertation research focused on understanding how amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides and insulin resistance contribute to cerebrovascular dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease, with a special emphasis on the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Key accomplishments include:\n\n📊 Developed a population pharmacokinetic model to study Aβ isoform trafficking and accumulation at the BBB endothelium.\nPublished in Molecular Pharmaceutics\n🔬 Conducted flow cytometry, western blot, and confocal imaging to investigate distinct molecular mechanisms of Aβ uptake and intracellular trafficking in BBB endothelial cells.\nPublished in Molecular Pharmacology\n🧠 Established a compartmental PK model to deconvolve plasma kinetics of imaging tracers from dynamic SPECT/CT heart scans.\nPublished in Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics\n🧪 Studied the effect of HDL mimetic peptides and gut microbiome metabolites on Aβ accumulation using dynamic imaging and cellular assays.\nPublished in Molecular Pharmaceutics\n\n\n\n\n4F effect on Amyloid beta PK\n\n\n\n🧬 Interpreted time-series transcriptomics of insulin-exposed BBB endothelial cells and co-authored the manuscript.\nPublished in NPJ Systems Biology and Applications\n🔁 Built a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model to simulate insulin signaling and VCAM1 expression in BBB endothelial cells.
